#Canal Excavator Mod
##Introduction
The Canal Excavator Mod is a mod for the game Factorio. This mod introduces a way for players to dig canals. Contrary to previous water mods, the canal excavator mod can only create water nearby other bodies of water. Bringing water to a desert will be a large undertaking.

##Key Features
1. **The Canal Excavator**
The centerpiece of this mod is the Canal Excavator: A large 8x10 structure that serves as tool for digging canals. This  machine can be placed on special tiles and once powered will begin excavating the designated area.

2. **Excavatable Tiles**
To facilitate the creation of canals, the mod introduces special excavatable tiles. These tiles be placed like any other tiles, but unlike other tiles, they can be mined for stone. 

3. **Water Transition**
After an excavatable tile has been depleted by the Canal Excavator, the tile transitions into a _dug_ state. If the tile is connected to a water tile, the dug tile changes in a water tile as well. It then checks if other neighbouring tiles are dug which will transitioned as well. 


## Mod Compatibility

**Space Exploration**
This mod was created with Space Exploration in mind. Other water mods often allow you to create water on planets where no source exists. This mod limits you to only create water nearby existing bodies of water.

**Cargo Ships**
The size of the Excavator was decided such that it streches the complete width of a canal that fits the cargo ships nicely.

**Other mods**
This mod should be compatible with most other mods since it only adds new objects and doesn't modify any existing ones. 

## Future Plans
Currently I'm still finishing up the main functionality of the mod. After the initial release I'm thinking about further compatibilty with Space Exploration. Since not all planets are stone rich, I want to modify the dug resource by the planet it's on. The exact implementation of this idea has yet to be decided.
