[mod-setting-description]
place-shallow-water=Place shallow water instead of deep water. Shallow water can be traversed by both players as well as biters. Enabled this setting if blocking off biters with water feels too cheaty to you. (Currently only available for Alien Biomes since that mod modifies the shallow water collision mask to allow this to work)
auto-deconstruct=Automatically mark an entity for deconstruction when the tile beneath it is marked for excavation.
no-tiles=Factorio has a limit of 255 tile prototypes. Some mods such as Alien Biomes adds a ton of tiles, which can result in you hitting the 255 limit. By default this mod adds two tiles: "Digable" and "Dug". With this setting on, the mod reuses Factorio's "Yellow Refined Concrete" for "Digable" and "Brown Refined Concrete" for "Dug". If no other mod you use changes these two tile types, this setting is a purely cosmetic change.
