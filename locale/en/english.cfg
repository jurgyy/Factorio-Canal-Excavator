[mod-setting-name]
auto-deconstruct=Automatic deconstruct
no-tiles=Don't introduce new tiles

[mod-setting-description]
auto-deconstruct=Automatically mark an entity for deconstruction when the tile beneath it is marked for excavation.
no-tiles=Factorio has a limit of 255 tile prototypes. Some mods such as Alien Biomes adds a ton of tiles, which can result in you hitting the 255 limit. By default this mod adds two tiles: "Digable" and "Dug". With this setting on, the mod reuses Factorio's "Yellow Refined Concrete" for "Digable" and "Brown Refined Concrete" for "Dug". If no other mod you use changes these two tile types, this setting is a purely cosmetic change.

canex-digable=Excavatable surface

[item-description]
canex-excavator=Excavates surfaces prepared with [item=canex-digable] so water can flow. For more details watch the Tips-and-Tricks.
canex-digable=Mark ground as excavatable by the [item=canex-excavator].

canex-rsc-digable=Created when placing [item=canex-digable] __1__.
canex-rsc-digable-surface=Excavatable resource __1__
canex-on=on __1__

[tile-name]
canex-digable=Excavatable surface tile
canex-dug=Excavated surface

[tile-description]
canex-dug=Tile that when it touches water changes into water itself (or similar tiles on other planets such as Lava on Vulcanus)

[technology-name]
canex-excavator=Canal excavator

[technology-description]
canex-excavator=Excavate water channels

[story]
canex-already-dug=Tile is already dug
canex-remaining=Remaining: __1__
canex-dug=Transition in: __1__
canex-invalid-surface=Unable to dig on this surface
canex-not-on-landfill=Cannot excavate landfill
canex-not-in-water=Cannot excavate water

[command]
canex-transition-dug=Force all tiles that have registered for transition to do so. Can fix cases where the transition is somehow missed.
canex-reset-partially-dug=All tiles that are partially dug but then canceled are stored in a table that can get large if it happens often. This command empties it.
canex-debug=[surfaceName] - Shows the state of all dug-, registered to transition- and partially dug tiles.
canex-show-surface-config=[surfaceName] - Shows the configuration of a/all surface(s).
canax-remove-floating=Remove all Dig resources that have no digable tile under them. This can occur when another mod removes the tile without notifying my mod.

[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
canex-excavator-tnt=In order to build the [entity=canex-excavator] you must first place down [item=canex-digable] tiles and build the excavator on top.
canex-canals-tnt=After the [entity=canex-excavator] has extracted all resources from the [item=canex-digable], the excavated tiles next to a water source will transition into water tiles.\nNot only canals with [tile=water] can be excavated. The water type of the source is copied.
canex-canals-sa-tnt=\nDifferent planets might yield different results when mined. Excavating on [planet=gleba], for instance, yields [item=spoilage].
