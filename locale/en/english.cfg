[mod-setting-name]
auto-deconstruct=Automatic deconstruct
no-tiles=Don't introduce new tiles

[mod-setting-description]
auto-deconstruct=Automatically mark an entity for deconstruction when the tile beneath it is marked for excavation.
no-tiles=Factorio has a limit of 255 tile prototypes. Some mods such as Alien Biomes adds a ton of tiles, which can result in you hitting the 255 limit. By default this mod adds two tiles: "Digable" and "Dug". With this setting on, the mod reuses Factorio's "Yellow Refined Concrete" for "Digable" and "Brown Refined Concrete" for "Dug". If no other mod you use changes these two tile types, this setting is a purely cosmetic change.
