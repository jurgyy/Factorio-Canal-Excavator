Version: 1.9.0
Date: 2025-12-07
  Features:
    - A surface is no long excavatable by default when Space Age isn't enabled.
    - Improved support for Space Exploration. Icy planets now yield ice and vitamelange planets yield vitamelange.
  Balancing:
    - The excavator no longer benefits from productivity bonuses. 
  Modding:
    - Now supports any surface to be excavatable instead of just planet surfaces.
    - Added support for templating configuration and surfaces generated during runtime. See the modding section on the readme page.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.8.0
Date: 2025-12-06
  Features:
    - Removed no-tiles setting since it wasn't needed anymore since 2.0. If you used it and you encounter any issues _don't_ save the game, roll back this mod and send me the save file. ([#10](https://github.com/jurgyy/Factorio-Canal-Excavator/issues/10))

Version: 1.5.1
Date: 2025-10-28
  Bugfixes:
    - Now raises set_tile events when placing dug tiles and water
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.5.0
Date: 2025-09-25
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed crash on startup when Space Exploration is installed.
  Features:
    - [Known Issue] Space Exploration automatically removes the "Digable" tiles on space surfaces like asteroids without notifying my mod which means I can't remove the ores that are placed with them. If you ever encounter this issue use the new console command /canex-remove-floating-resources which should remove them.
    - Moved Excavator tech earlier in the tech tree when Space Exploration is installed. It is now behind Big Electrical Engines and Concret and requires Chemical Science instead of Rocket Science.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version: 1.3.0
Date: 2025-01-11
  Features:
    - Added support for all vanilla planets
    - Added remote interface for other modders to use to add planet configuration by calling `canex_register_planet_config` during the data or data-updates stage.
    - When transitioning to water tile, the new tile now matches the neighboring water tile. For instance if the neighboring tile is shallow water, the excavated tile will also become shallow water. Removed place-shallow-water setting.
    - Added new resource icon in the Factoriopedia
  Bugfixes:
    - Added tile information on the Factoriopedia page of excavated tiles
    - Added tile information to the Factoriopedia page of the excavatable tile
    - Fixed edge case where water could be set twice on the same tile in rapid succession
    - Made the player move script when water is placed under them safer
  Locale:
    - Added help text to the four commands

Version: 1.2.5
Date: 2025-01-03
  Bugfixes:
    - Internally the canal tile item and recipe now have the same name so they show up as a single page in the Factoriopedia
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.4
Date: 2025-01-01
  Bugfixes:
    - Removed a lingering on_research_finished event from the 1.x version
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.3
Date: 2025-01-01
  Bugfixes:
    - [Spage Age] Fixed undo-stack not properly being cleared when placing tiles on forbidden planet
    - Fixed landfill being consumed from a player's inventory when digable tiles were placed on landfill.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.2
Date: 2025-01-01

    - Fixed dug tiles not transitioning in water when landfill next to it was mined.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.1
Date: 2025-01-01
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed graphics mod dependency still pointing to pre-Factorio 2.0 version
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.2.0
Date: 2025-01-01
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed bug where water spawned underneath the character didn't teleport the character to a safe position
  Features:
    - [Space Age] Only planets similar to Nauvis (same pressure) can be dug. I will later look into supporting the other planets.
    - The excavator now actually benefits from productivity bonuses. Previously this was counteracted so you couldn't infinitely generate stone by crafting landfill, placing it and excavating it. But now landfill can be mined by hand this isn't necessary anymore and simplifies the mod logic.
    - When ghost excavatable tiles aren't able to be placed for any reason the place-ghost events should now be removed from the player's undo-stack as if nothing happened.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.7
Date: 2024-07-30
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed resources always spawning when tiles are set by a script (such as Repair Turrets). There is a known issue where removing the Excavatable Surface by script leaves the ore/stone behind. The current workaround is to place the tiles again and remove them by hand or by using bots.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.6
Date: 2024-07-25
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed rare crash when a digable tile is placed on a already dug tile by a robot
